## About
Rotera is a game programmed in Unity3D with C# that utilizes physics in a three-dimensional world. The player controls a rolling ball, which the intent of reaching the end of an obstacle course riddled with hazards.

The game utilizes time-scaled physics, in which the motion of all obstacle objects are scaled to the player's kinetic energy - the faster the play is moving, the faster time will pass in the game.
