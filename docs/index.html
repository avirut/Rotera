      <p><strong>Rotera</strong> is a game programmed in Unity3D with C# that utilizes physics in a three-dimensional world. The player controls a <strong>rolling ball</strong>, which the intent of reaching the end of an obstacle course riddled with hazards.</p>
      
      <p>The game utilizes <strong>time-scaled physics</strong>, in which the motion of all obstacle objects are scaled to the player's kinetic energy - the faster the play is moving, the faster time will pass in the game.</p>.
